# Model Free Learning

## Code structure
* There are two files, `DQN_Implementation.py` and `config.py`
* `DQN_Implementation.py` can be run on python without passing any arguments (`python DQN_Implementation.py`)
* `config.py` contains the hyperparameter configurations for training, along with some helper functions
* Model checkpoints are stored every 10,000 iterations of training, from which plots can be generated later
